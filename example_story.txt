INT/EXT. Enchanted forest. - Scene 1




Here is an original dialogue for the scene in the enchanted forest:

RABBIT: (scurrying through the undergrowth) Hurry, hurry! The lumberjack will be here soon to try and chop down our precious golden apple tree.

FOX: (prowling cautiously) Yes, we must be vigilant. That greedy lumberjack has been eyeing our tree for weeks, just waiting for a chance to get his hands on those golden apples.

CROW: (perched high in the branches) Caw caw! I'll keep a sharp eye out from up here. The moment I spot that lumberjack, I'll let out a warning cry.

RABBIT: Good, good. We must work together to protect our home and our bounty. Those golden apples sustain us all through the long, harsh winters.

FOX: Indeed. Without the tree, we would surely perish. We cannot let that lumberjack succeed in his selfish plans.

CROW: Caw caw! I see movement in the distance! He approaches, that scruffy, greedy lumberjack!

RABBIT: Quick, everyone, take your positions! We must hide the axe before he arrives!

(The animals scurry about, working in concert to conceal the lumberjack's axe as he comes into view, grumbling to himself.)


INT/EXT. Enchanted forest. - Scene 2


Here is a possible dialogue for the scene in the enchanted forest:

LUMBERJACK (looking around greedily): Ah, what a fine golden apple tree! Just the sort of treasure I've been searching for. With that tree, I'll be rich beyond my wildest dreams.

RABBIT (scurrying out from the bushes): Stop right there, you greedy lumberjack! That tree is not yours to take.

FOX (sauntering up): The rabbit speaks the truth. This forest and all its wonders are protected by us - the cunning animals who call it home.

CROW (swooping down from a tree branch): You have no right to lay a hand on that tree. Be gone from our enchanted forest before we are forced to take action!

LUMBERJACK (laughing): Ha! You foolish creatures think you can stop me? I've come prepared. (He pulls out a large axe.) This axe will make quick work of your precious tree.

RABBIT (to Fox and Crow): We must not let him succeed! Think of a plan to stop him.

FOX (whispering to the others): I have an idea. Follow my lead.

(The animals begin to distract and confuse the lumberjack, working together to hide his axe and lead him astray in the forest.)


INT/EXT. Enchanted forest. - Scene 3


Here is a possible dialogue for the scene in the enchanted forest:

RABBIT: (Scurrying up to the Fox and Crow) Did you see that lumberjack lurking around the golden apple tree? He means to chop it down!

FOX: (Narrowing its eyes) That tree is the heart of our enchanted forest. We can't let that greedy lumberjack destroy it.

CROW: (Ruffling its feathers) We must stop him before he raises his axe. But how can the three of us stand against a human?

RABBIT: (Pacing back and forth) We need to work together. If we combine our cunning, we can outsmart that lumberjack and protect our home.

FOX: (Nodding) Yes, the rabbit's quick thinking, the crow's sharp eyes, and my own sly tricks - together we stand a chance.

CROW: (Hopping closer) Then let us devise a plan to hide his axe and send that lumberjack running from our forest!

RABBIT: (Grinning) I have an idea. Follow me, my friends. Time is of the essence!

(The three animals scurry off, determined to save the golden apple tree from the greedy lumberjack.)


INT/EXT. Enchanted forest. - Scene 4


Here is a possible dialogue for the scene in the enchanted forest:

RABBIT
(Scurrying up to the fox and crow) My friends, the lumberjack approaches! We must act quickly to save the golden apple tree.

FOX
(Pacing back and forth) Yes, yes, we cannot let him destroy our home. What do you propose we do?

CROW
(Perched on a branch, cawing loudly) We must distract him somehow, keep him away from the tree.

RABBIT
I have an idea! Let's hide his axe, make it impossible for him to cut down the tree.

FOX
(Rubbing his paws together) Excellent plan, my furry friend. Where shall we stash the axe?

CROW
(Flapping his wings) I saw him leave it by the old oak tree. If we can get it there before he returns, he'll be powerless to harm our precious tree.

RABBIT
Then let's be off! Time is of the essence. (The three animals scurry off to hide the lumberjack's axe)

LUMBERJACK
(Entering the clearing, looking around confused) Now where did I leave that axe? (Scratches his head) Hmm, no matter. I'll just have to find another way to chop down this tree. (Starts searching the area)


INT/EXT. Enchanted forest. - Scene 5


Here is an original dialogue for the scene in the enchanted forest:

RABBIT
(Scurrying up to the Fox and Crow) The lumberjack is getting closer! He's searching everywhere for his missing axe.

FOX
(Rubbing his paws together) Excellent, our plan is working. The greedy fool will never find that axe now.

CROW
(Perched on a branch, cawing) Yes, the golden apple tree is safe, thanks to our clever scheme. The lumberjack will have to give up and leave this forest for good.

LUMBERJACK
(Stomping into the clearing, shouting) Where is my axe? I know you animals are behind this! If I can't find it, I'll just have to tear that tree down with my bare hands!

RABBIT
(Trembling) Oh no, he's getting desperate! We have to do something before he destroys the tree.

FOX
(Slyly) Leave this to me. I'll reason with the lumberjack and convince him to give up.

(The Fox approaches the Lumberjack)

FOX
Good sir, surely there's no need for such drastic measures. Why don't you simply return home and leave this forest in peace?

LUMBERJACK
(Glaring) Not a chance, you mangy fox! That tree is worth a fortune, and I won't let a bunch of animals stand in my way.

FOX
(Calmly) But think of the damage you would do, not just to the tree, but to the entire delicate balance of this enchanted forest. Is the gold really worth that price?

LUMBERJACK
(Pausing, considering) Hmm, I suppose you make a fair point. Very well, I'll leave for now. But mark my words, I'll be back, and next time I won't be so easily swayed!

(The Lumberjack storms off, grumbling. The Rabbit and Crow emerge from their hiding places.)

RABBIT
(Relieved) You did it, Fox! You convinced him to go.

CROW
(Cawing) For now, at least. We'll have to remain vigilant to protect our home.

FOX
(Nodding) Indeed. This forest holds many secrets, and we must use our wits to keep it safe from those who would do it harm.

Here is an original dialogue for the scene in the enchanted forest:

LUMBERJACK (frustrated): Where is my axe? I know you animals are hiding it from me! I won't stop until I find it and cut down that golden apple tree!

RABBIT (smugly): You'll never find your axe, lumberjack. We've hidden it too well.

FOX (slyly): That's right. The tree is ours, and we'll do whatever it takes to protect it from the likes of you.

CROW (cawing loudly): Caw caw caw! You're wasting your time. Just give up and leave this forest!

LUMBERJACK (angrily): I won't be mocked by a bunch of animals! That tree is worth a fortune, and I'll get my axe back one way or another.

RABBIT (confidently): Good luck with that. We're one step ahead of you. Face it, you've lost this battle.

LUMBERJACK (defeated): Argh! Fine, I'll leave. But mark my words, I'll be back, and I'll find a way to cut down that tree!

(The lumberjack storms off, while the rabbit, fox, and crow celebrate their victory in protecting the enchanted forest.)


INT/EXT. Enchanted forest. - Scene 7


Here is an original dialogue for the scene in the enchanted forest:

RABBIT
(Hopping excitedly) We did it! We outsmarted that greedy lumberjack and saved our golden apple tree!

FOX
(Grinning mischievously) Indeed we did, my furry friend. That look on his face when he couldn't find his axe was priceless.

CROW
(Cawing triumphantly) Caw caw! The forest is ours once more. No one will be chopping down our precious tree on my watch.

RABBIT
(Nodding) Thanks to your quick thinking, Fox, and your sharp eyes, Crow. I couldn't have done it without you both.

FOX
(Chuckling) Ah, don't sell yourself short, Rabbit. Your quick footwork and clever distractions were crucial.

CROW
(Ruffling his feathers) Yes, we make quite the formidable team! The lumberjack didn't stand a chance.

RABBIT
(Hopping in a circle) This calls for a celebration! Let's feast on the golden apples to our heart's content.

FOX
(Licking his lips) Excellent idea. I could go for a juicy apple right about now.

CROW
(Swooping down to perch on a branch) Then let the feasting begin! The enchanted forest is safe once more.
